	<h4>Quotes</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>This is useful when you have a long quotation<br> or a 
		pull quote or just a section where you need <br>indented stuff.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>When the quote is smaller you include it inline. Like
	<cite>my mother</cite> always said,<br>
	<q>Give credit where it is due</q>
	It is easier to find quote when they are marked</p>
